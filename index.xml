      <description>Introduction Namaste üôè , It‚Äôs been a while I have been thinking about creating a new website for me but procrastination was always been in my way. Finally, I‚Äôm here with the new website I always used to think of what does it feels like to have your portfolio and sharing your life experience with other people.
I will post all the content that I‚Äôm learning let it be technical or non-technical and also will like to know your comment on it.</description>

      <description>About Hello there üëã, I am Sachin Maurya a final year student at Xavier Institute of Engineering majoring in Information Technology and currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working as a Technical writer Intern at CloudYuga.
I have always been passionate about computers, software programming, and technology as a whole. The thrill of building something I envisioned in my mind and watching it work is something I‚Äôve always been a fan of. Recently, I have been obsessed with how important it is for technology to be used in an ethically right way.</description>
